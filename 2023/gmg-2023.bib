    abstract = {We present a multiagent-based model that captures the interactions between different types of cells with their microenvironment, and enables the analysis of the emergent global behavior during tissue regeneration and tumor development. Using this model, we are able to reproduce the temporal dynamics of regular healthy cells and cancer cells, as well as the evolution of their three-dimensional spatial distributions. By tuning the system with the characteristics of the individual patients, our model reproduces a variety of spatial patterns of tissue regeneration and tumor growth, resembling those found in clinical imaging or biopsies. In order to calibrate and validate our model we study the process of liver regeneration after surgical hepatectomy in different degrees. In the clinical context, our model is able to predict the recurrence of a hepatocellular carcinoma after a 70\% partial hepatectomy. The outcomes of our simulations are in agreement with experimental and clinical observations. By fitting the model parameters to specific patient factors, it might well become a useful platform for hypotheses testing in treatments protocols.},

abstract = {Abstract Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) are responsible for the long-chain fatty acids (FAs) transport inside the cell. However, despite the years, since their structure is known and the many studies published, there is no definitive answer about the stages of the lipid entry-exit mechanism. Their structure forms a β-barrel of 10 anti-parallel strands with a cap in a helix-turn-helix motif, and there is some consensus on the role of the so-called portal region, involving the second α-helix from the cap (α2), βC–βD, and βE–βF turns in FAs exchange. To test the idea of a lid that opens, we performed a soaking experiment on an h-FABP crystal in which the cap is part of the packing contacts, and its movement is strongly restricted. Even in these conditions, we observed the replacement of palmitic acid by 2-Bromohexadecanoic acid (Br-palmitic acid). Our MD simulations reveal a two-step lipid entry process: (i) The travel of the lipid head through the cavity in the order of tens of nanoseconds, and (ii) The accommodation of its hydrophobic tail in hundreds to thousands of nanoseconds. We observed this even in the cases in which the FAs enter the cavity by their tail. During this process, the FAs do not follow a single trajectory, but multiple ones through which they get into the protein cavity. Thanks to the complementary views between experiment and simulation, we can give an approach to a mechanistic view of the exchange process.},

TITLE = {Low-Frequency Electrical Conductivity of Trabecular Bone: Insights from In Silico Modeling},
JOURNAL = {Mathematics},
VOLUME = {11},

ABSTRACT = {Background: The electrical conductivity of trabecular bone at 100 kHz has recently been reported as a good predictor of bone volume fraction. However, quantifying its relationship with free water (or physiological solution) content and the conductivities of its constituents is still difficult. Methods: In this contribution, in silico models inspired by microCT images of trabecular bovine samples were used to build realistic geometries. The finite element method was applied to solve the electrical problem and to robustly fit the conductivity of the constituents to the literature data. The obtained effective electrical conductivity was compared with the Bruggeman three-medium mixture model using a physiological solution, bone marrow and a bone matrix. Results: The values for the physiological solution plus bone marrow (together as one material) and the bone matrix that best captured the bone volume fraction in the two-medium finite element model were &sigma;ps+bm = 298.4 mS/m and &sigma;b = 21.0 mS/m, respectively. Additionally, relatively good results were obtained with the three-medium Bruggeman mixture model, with &sigma;bm= 103 mS/m, &sigma;b= 21.0 mS/m and &sigma;ps= 1200 mS/m. Simple linear relationships between the proportions of constituents depending on bone volume fraction were tested. Degree of anisotropy and fractal dimension do not show detectable changes in effective conductivity. Conclusions: These results provided some useful findings for simulation purposes. First, a higher value for the electrical conductivity of bone marrow has to be used in order to obtain similar values to those of experimental published data. Second, anisotropy is not detectable with conductivity measurements for small trabecular samples (5 mm cube). Finally, the simulations presented here showed relatively good fitting of the Bruggeman mixture model, which would potentially account for the free water content and could rescale the model for whole-bone electrical simulations.},

abstract = {We investigate the effect of a bevelled (or slanted) outlet on the discharge rate of mono-sized spheres from a quasi-two-dimensional silo, using the discrete element method. In contrast to hopper discharges, where the bevelling is across the entire base of the container, we study a bevelled opening that is significantly smaller than the silo width and in which the slanting is limited to half a sphere diameter at the boundary of the outlet. We show that the bevelling increases the flow rate comparably to the inclination in hopper walls. Using Beverloo’s model, we relate this increase in rate to what we define as the ‘effective opening’ of the silo and analyse the velocity profiles associated with the discharges. We show that different openings, having effectively the same discharge rates, give rise to distinctly different internal dynamics in the silo. These results have the potential to aid industrial processes by fine-tuning and improving control of silo discharges, with a minimal impact on silo design, thus significantly reducing production and handling costs.},

ABSTRACT = {Competing interactions between charged inclusions in membranes of living organisms or charged nanoparticles in near-critical mixtures can lead to self-assembly into various patterns. Motivated by these systems, we developed a simple triangular lattice model for binary mixtures of oppositely charged particles with additional short-range attraction or repulsion between like or different particles, respectively. We determined the ground state for the system in contact with a reservoir of the particles for the whole chemical potentials plane, and the structure of self-assembled conglomerates for fixed numbers of particles. Stability of the low-temperature ordered patterns was verified by Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, we performed molecular dynamics simulations for a continuous model with interactions having similar features, but a larger range and lower strength than in the lattice model. Interactions with and without symmetry between different components were assumed. We investigated both the conglomerate formed in the center of a thin slit with repulsive walls, and the structure of a monolayer adsorbed at an attractive substrate. Both models give the same patterns for large chemical potentials or densities. For low densities, more patterns occur in the lattice model. Different phases coexist with dilute gas on the lattice and in the continuum, leading to different patterns in self-assembled conglomerates (‘rafts’).},

abstract  ="Systems with short-range attraction and long-range repulsion can form ordered microphases in bulk and under confinement. In fact{,} confinement has been proven to be a good strategy to induce the formation of novel ordered microphases that might be appealing to the development of functional nanomaterials. Using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations{,} we study a model colloidal system with competing interactions under confinement in narrow spherical shells at thermodynamic conditions under which the hexagonal phase is stable in bulk. We observe the formation of three parent ordered structures formed by toroidal clusters and two spherical clusters (Type I){,} toroidal clusters and one spherical cluster (Type II){,} and toroidal clusters alone (Type III){,} depending on the radius of the confining shell{,} that can often coexist with other related structures derived from these parent ones by a simple transformation{,} in which the system is divided into two hemispheres that are rotated with respect to each other by a given angle. We propose a general method to characterize and predict the structures obtained under confinement in spherical shells in systems able to self-assemble into a hexagonal phase in bulk. We also show that deforming the spherical shells into ellipsoidal ones affects the structure of the system in such a way that helical structures are favoured by prolate ellipsoids and toroidal structures by oblate ellipsoids.",

abstract={Steel silos with corrugated walls are widely used to reduce the weight of the steel used for their construction, while eccentric hoppers are used sometimes for facilitating the discharge process of the silo. Previous numerically results obtained by several authors suggest that the outlet eccentricity can affect the circumferential distribution of pressures exerted by the stored material over the silo wall and the discharge flow. However, very few experimental tests have been reported in literature with regards to eccentric hoppers or corrugated walls. A silo model with corrugated steel walls and a square cross section has been constructed, with different bottom configurations (flat bottom and hoppers with 0{\%}, 50{\%} and 100{\%} outlet eccentricity). The vertical section of the silo model consisted of two independent modules, each one with 0.75 m height and 0.45 m width and length. The depth and wavelength of corrugations were 13 mm and 75 mm, respectively. All solutions had a square outlet with 0.06 m, and every hopper had 0.175 m height. In addition, two square test panels with 0.15 m length were placed at the corrugated walls for each vertical section of the silo model, while wood pellets were used as the bulk material and two filling methods (central and distributed) were checked. It was found that outlet eccentricity affects the distribution of wall pressures, as well as the discharge rate of material. Distribute filling method tend to increase the flow rate during discharge.},
