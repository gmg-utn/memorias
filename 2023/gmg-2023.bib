    abstract = {We present a multiagent-based model that captures the interactions between different types of cells with their microenvironment, and enables the analysis of the emergent global behavior during tissue regeneration and tumor development. Using this model, we are able to reproduce the temporal dynamics of regular healthy cells and cancer cells, as well as the evolution of their three-dimensional spatial distributions. By tuning the system with the characteristics of the individual patients, our model reproduces a variety of spatial patterns of tissue regeneration and tumor growth, resembling those found in clinical imaging or biopsies. In order to calibrate and validate our model we study the process of liver regeneration after surgical hepatectomy in different degrees. In the clinical context, our model is able to predict the recurrence of a hepatocellular carcinoma after a 70\% partial hepatectomy. The outcomes of our simulations are in agreement with experimental and clinical observations. By fitting the model parameters to specific patient factors, it might well become a useful platform for hypotheses testing in treatments protocols.},

abstract = {Abstract Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) are responsible for the long-chain fatty acids (FAs) transport inside the cell. However, despite the years, since their structure is known and the many studies published, there is no definitive answer about the stages of the lipid entry-exit mechanism. Their structure forms a β-barrel of 10 anti-parallel strands with a cap in a helix-turn-helix motif, and there is some consensus on the role of the so-called portal region, involving the second α-helix from the cap (α2), βC–βD, and βE–βF turns in FAs exchange. To test the idea of a lid that opens, we performed a soaking experiment on an h-FABP crystal in which the cap is part of the packing contacts, and its movement is strongly restricted. Even in these conditions, we observed the replacement of palmitic acid by 2-Bromohexadecanoic acid (Br-palmitic acid). Our MD simulations reveal a two-step lipid entry process: (i) The travel of the lipid head through the cavity in the order of tens of nanoseconds, and (ii) The accommodation of its hydrophobic tail in hundreds to thousands of nanoseconds. We observed this even in the cases in which the FAs enter the cavity by their tail. During this process, the FAs do not follow a single trajectory, but multiple ones through which they get into the protein cavity. Thanks to the complementary views between experiment and simulation, we can give an approach to a mechanistic view of the exchange process.},

TITLE = {Low-Frequency Electrical Conductivity of Trabecular Bone: Insights from In Silico Modeling},
JOURNAL = {Mathematics},
VOLUME = {11},
YEAR = {2023},
NUMBER = {19},

ABSTRACT = {Background: The electrical conductivity of trabecular bone at 100 kHz has recently been reported as a good predictor of bone volume fraction. However, quantifying its relationship with free water (or physiological solution) content and the conductivities of its constituents is still difficult. Methods: In this contribution, in silico models inspired by microCT images of trabecular bovine samples were used to build realistic geometries. The finite element method was applied to solve the electrical problem and to robustly fit the conductivity of the constituents to the literature data. The obtained effective electrical conductivity was compared with the Bruggeman three-medium mixture model using a physiological solution, bone marrow and a bone matrix. Results: The values for the physiological solution plus bone marrow (together as one material) and the bone matrix that best captured the bone volume fraction in the two-medium finite element model were &sigma;ps+bm = 298.4 mS/m and &sigma;b = 21.0 mS/m, respectively. Additionally, relatively good results were obtained with the three-medium Bruggeman mixture model, with &sigma;bm= 103 mS/m, &sigma;b= 21.0 mS/m and &sigma;ps= 1200 mS/m. Simple linear relationships between the proportions of constituents depending on bone volume fraction were tested. Degree of anisotropy and fractal dimension do not show detectable changes in effective conductivity. Conclusions: These results provided some useful findings for simulation purposes. First, a higher value for the electrical conductivity of bone marrow has to be used in order to obtain similar values to those of experimental published data. Second, anisotropy is not detectable with conductivity measurements for small trabecular samples (5 mm cube). Finally, the simulations presented here showed relatively good fitting of the Bruggeman mixture model, which would potentially account for the free water content and could rescale the model for whole-bone electrical simulations.},
