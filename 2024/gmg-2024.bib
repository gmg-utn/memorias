  ABSTRACT = {A long-standing debate regarding the dynamics of silo discharge
              revolves around the use of mono-dispersed circular or spherical
              grains in simplified two-dimensional models. It is well-known that
              granular systems composed of particles of the same size can
              generate crystal or quasi-crystal domains with specific structural
              and dynamic behaviors. Can this ordering affect the flow rate to an
              extent that monosized systems cannot be good models for realistic
              materials? In this work, we present simulations of the discharge of
              two-dimensional silos filled with binary mixtures of circular
              grains that conserve the same mean particle size. We address the
              question of how ordering affects the mass flow rate, in particular
              considering the limit of mono-sized systems. We find that the
              typical hexagonal order observed does not affect the flow rate
              significantly. However, the flow rate does exhibit a weak,
              nonmonotonic dependence on packing bidispersity that correlates
              with changes in the outpouring speed of grains in the vicinity of
              the orifice.},

  ABSTRACT = {Recent studies revealed anomalous underscreening in concentrated
              electrolytes, and we suggest that the underscreened electrostatic
              forces between membrane proteins play a significant role in the
              process of self-assembly. In this work, we assumed that the
              underscreened electrostatic forces compete with the thermodynamic
              Casimir forces induced by concentration fluctuations in the lipid
              bilayer, and developed a simplified model for a binary mixture of
              oppositely charged membrane proteins with different preference to
              liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered domains in the membrane. In
              the model, like macromolecules interact with short-range Casimir
              attraction and long-range electrostatic repulsion, and the
              cross-interaction is of the opposite sign. We determine
              energetically favored patterns in a system in equilibrium with a
              bulk reservoir of the macromolecules. Different patterns consisting
              of clusters and stripes of the two components and of vacancies are
              energetically favorable for different values of the chemical
              potentials. Effects of thermal flutuations at low temperature are
              studied using Monte Carlo simulations in grand canonical and
              canonical ensembles. For fixed numbers of the macromolecules, a
              single two-component cluster with a regular pattern coexists with
              dispersed small one-component clusters, and the number of small
              clusters depends on the ratio of the numbers of the molecules of
              the two components. Our results show that the pattern formation is
              controlled by the shape of the interactions, the density of the
              proteins, and the proportion of the components.},

  ABSTRACT = {A monolayer consisting of two types of particles, with
              energetically favored alternating stripes of the two components, is
              studied by Monte Carlo simulations and within a mesoscopic theory.
              We consider a triangular lattice model and assume short-range
              attraction and long-range repulsion between particles of the same
              kind, as well as short-range repulsion and long-range attraction
              for the cross-interaction. The structural evolution of the model
              upon increasing temperature is studied for equal chemical
              potentials of the two species. We determine the structure factor,
              the chemical potential–density isotherms, the specific heat, and
              the compressibility, and show how these thermodynamic functions are
              associated with the spontaneous formation of stripes with varying
              degrees of order.},

              three stable phases with periodic concentration: the lamellar L

              chemical potentials{,} and a hexagonal arrangement of the clusters
              of the minority component in the liquid of the majority component.
              The latter two phases{,} however{,} are stable only at relatively
              high temperatures. At lower temperatures{,} the L phase coexists
              with a disordered one-component fluid or with very dilute gas with
              mixed components. At still lower temperatures{,} the one-component
              phase coexisting with the L phase can be disordered or ordered{,}
              depending on the chemical potentials. The theoretical results are

              walls, and with a configurable base to set different discharge
              conditions. Normal and tangential forces at different heights on

              determine whether the flow of the material during discharge was
              greater with decreasing material particle size. An increase in
              normal and tangential forces was recorded for all materials tested
              during discharge, especially in the upper part of the silo.
              Pinewood pellets showed a greater mobilisation of internal friction

              radiofrequency ablation’, a point of view of Futyma et al.1 The
              authors state that ‘when the dispersive patch electrodes (DPEs) are
              placed incorrectly, it can lead to suboptimal lesion formation and
              potentially increase the risk of adverse events’. However, they do

  abstract = {Abstract An epicardial approach is often used in radiofrequency
              (RF) catheter ablation to ablate ventricular tachycardia when an
              endocardial approach fails. Our objective was to analyze the effect
              of the position of the dispersive patch (DP) on lesion size using
              computer modeling during epicardial approach. We compared the
              posterior position (patient's back), commonly used in clinical
              practice, to the anterior position (patient's chest). The model
              considered ventricular wall thicknesses between 4 and 8 mm, and
              electrode insertion depths between .3 and .7 mm. RF pulses were
              simulated with 20 W of power for 30 s duration. Statistically
              significant differences (P < .001) were found between both DP
              positions in terms of baseline impedance, RF current (at 15 s) and
              thermal lesion size. The anterior position involved lower impedance
              (130.8 ± 4.7 vs. 146.2 ± 4.9 Ω) and a higher current (401.5 ± 5.6
              vs. 377.5 ± 5.1 mA). The anterior position created lesion sizes
              larger than the posterior position: 8.9 ± 0.4 vs. 8.4 ± 0.4 mm in
              maximum width, 8.6 ± 0.4 vs. 8.1 ± 0.4 mm in surface width, and 4.5
              ± 0.4 vs. 4.3 ± 0.4 mm in depth. Our results suggest that: (1) the
              redirection of the RF currents due to repositioning the PD has
              little impact on lesion size and only affects baseline impedance,
              and (2) the differences in lesion size are only 0.5 mm wider and
              0.2 mm deeper for the anterior position, which does not seem to
              have a clinical impact in the context of VT ablation.},
