abstract={The flow of grains through narrow apertures possess an extraordinary challenge: clogging. Strategies to alleviate the effect of clogging, such as the use of external vibration or addition of smaller grains, are always part of the design of machinery for the handling of bulk materials. In this work, we study with numerical simulations the effect of adding self-repelling magnetic particles to a sample of grains. We consider a vibrated two-dimensional hopper with a small orifice through which disks flow and clog intermittently. We find that the magnetic repulsion has a second order effect in comparison with the effect of the size of the added grains. Small added grains ease the flow of the original species. However, when the magnetic repulsion is switched on for the added small grains their ``lubricating'' effect is usually lessened. Only for a narrow range of sizes of the added particles we observe a subtle improvement of flow rate of the original particles with magnetic repulsion.},

abstract = {The molecular structure of membrane lipids is formed by mono- or polyunsaturations on their aliphatic tails that make them susceptible to oxidation, facilitating the incorporation of hydroperoxide (R-OOH) functional groups. Such groups promote changes in both composition and complexity of the membrane significantly modifying its physicochemical properties. Human Langerhans islets amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) is the main component of amyloid deposits found in the pancreas of patients with type-2 diabetes (T2D). hIAPP in the presence of membranes with oxidized lipid species accelerates the formation of amyloid fibrils or the formation of intermediate oligomeric structures. However, the molecular bases at the initial stage of the anchoring and stabilization of the hIAPP in a hydroperoxidized membrane are not yet well understood. To shed some light on this matter, in this contribution, three bilayer models were modeled: neutral (POPC), anionic (POPS), and oxidized (POPCOOH), and full atom Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were performed. Our results show that the POPCOOH bilayer increases the helicity in hIAPP when compared to POPC or POPS bilayer. The modification in the secondary structure covers the residues of the so-called amyloidogenic core of the hIAPP. Overall, the hydroperoxidation of the neutral lipids modifies both the anchoring and the stabilization of the peptide hIAPP by reducing the random conformations of the peptide and increasing of hydrogen bond population with the hydroperoxidized lipids.}

TITLE = {Determination of the Angle of Repose and Coefficient of Rolling Friction for Wood Pellets},

ABSTRACT = {The determination of the angle of repose for granular materials is indispensable for their handling and the design of containers and technological processing equipment. On the other hand, computational simulations have become an essential tool to understand the micro-behavior of the granular material and to relate it with the macro-behavior. The experimental determination of the angle of repose has a fundamental role when defining the required parameters to perform realistic simulations. However, there is a lack of a standard that allows the reproducibility of the experiments when using granular materials of equivalent spherical radius greater than 2 mm, such as corn, soybeans, wheat and PLA pellets, among others. In particular, a product of growing importance in the global strategy of decarbonization of the economy is biomass pellets, whose handling operations are one of the main components for the total cost of pellets supplied to the final user. In the present work, with the aim of determining the rolling friction coefficient, the variations in the angle of repose with the drop height for biomass pellets were studied both experimentally and with simulations, and an optimal procedure for its determination was found. Then, a calibration of the coefficient of rolling friction was performed through computational simulations using the discrete element method. The accuracy of the model under different configurations was checked.},

abstract = {A binary self-assembling mixture near a planar wall is studied by theory and Monte Carlo simulations. The grand potential functional of the local concentration and the local volume fraction of all particles is developed in the framework of the density functional and field-theoretic methods. We obtain ordinary differential Euler–Lagrange equations for the concentration and the volume fraction, and solve them analytically in the perturbation expansion. The obtained exponentially damped oscillations of the concentration, with the characteristic lengths the same as in the concentration-concentration correlation function, agree very well with simulations. For the excess volume fraction we obtain a monotonic decay superimposed on the exponentially damped oscillations with a fair agreement with simulations. The period of the density oscillations is equal to half the period of the concentration oscillations in both the theory and simulations. Simulations show local ordering in the layers parallel to the wall that are rich in one of the two components. Bubbles, stripes and clusters appear in the subsequent layers for increasing distance from the wall. Between these almost one-component layers the density takes minima, and a bulk-like structure with clusters of different particles being nearest neighbors appears.}

@article{basiuk2022,
 abstract = {In recent years, there has been a number of experimental and numerical studies on the transport and settlement of proppant in scaled laboratory fractures that are of interest to understand hydraulic stimulation in hydrocarbon reservoirs. The results from these studies are generally taken with skepticism by the industry. Part of this is due to the perception that results must be very sensitive to the boundary conditions. Small changes in the experimental configuration are expected to lead to very different results. In particular, little is known on how the actual roughness of the fracture walls and the way the slurry is drained from the laboratory cell affect the results. Here, we report experimental results on the proppant transport in a scaled vertical rough cell that mimics a vertical fracture induced during stimulation. We compare results with those obtained in a smooth wall cell, which is more common in laboratory tests. We found that a rough wall allows for a significant increase in the amount of proppant deposited in the cell at high pumping rate. However, the effect of roughness seems to be marginal for low pumping rates, suggesting that most previous studies in the literature which use of a reduced pumping rate were not significantly affected by the use of smooth walls. We also designed different flow configurations at the fracture tip (where the slurry drains form the cell) to study their effect on the way in which the proppant is deposited in the fracture. We found that, in general, the deposited dune is fairly independent of the particular boundary conditions. This suggests that most results reported in the literature are also robust against changes in the selected outflow configuration.},
