  abstract = {We analyze the flow and clogging of circular grains passing through a small aperture under vibration in two dimensions. Via discrete element method simulations, we show that when grains smaller than the original ones are introduced in the system as an additive, the net flow of the original species can be significantly increased. Moreover, there is an optimal radius of the additive particles that maximizes the effect. This finding may constitute the basis for technological applications not only concerning the flow of granular materials but also regarding active matter, including pedestrian evacuation.}

  abstract = {In this work, we study bidisperse mixtures of self-propelled magnetic particles of different shapes via discrete element method simulations. We show how these particles self-assemble into clusters and how these clusters depend on the ratio of the mixture, the magnetic interaction, and the shape of the grains. It is found that the mix ratio of the system controls the cluster size. Besides, the intensity of the magnetic dipoles and the shape of the grains in the mixture rule the average number of neighbors in contact and the shape of the clusters. By varying the intensity of the interactions, globular, linear and branched clusters were obtained.}

abstract = { The interactions between particles in dense particulate systems are organized in force networks, mesoscale features that influence the macroscopic response to applied stresses. The detailed structure of these networks is, however, difficult to extract from experiments that cannot resolve individual contact forces. In this study, we showed that certain persistent homology (PH) measures extracted from data accessible to experiment are strongly correlated with the same features extracted from the full contact force network. We performed simulations known to accurately model experiments on an intruder being pushed through a two-dimensional (2D) granular layer and compared PH properties of full contact force networks and networks constructed using only the sum of the normal forces on each grain. We found that the main features were highly correlated, suggesting that data commonly available in experiments are sufficient for quantifying the structure of force networks in evolving granular systems. }

abstract = {We present simulations using a coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics–Discrete Element Method (CFD–DEM) approach for a slurry of millimeter-sized particles in water which is squeezed between two walls and then made flow out though a narrow aperture. The process is akin to the flowback stage in the near wellbore zone of a hydraulic-stimulated well for hydrocarbon recovery. We consider different wall roughness and investigate its effect on particle production, final distance between walls, spatial particle distribution between the walls, and fluid production rate. We have found that the final distribution of particles changes significantly with small variations in the roughnesses of the walls. This in turn leads to production flow rates that may vary up to 50\%. Although the main driver of the production for unconventional wells is the propped fracture network, these results suggest that the roughness of the fracture walls seems to play an important role in the final conductivity and therefore in the ultimate recovery.}

title={Effect of lateral confinement on the apparent mass of granular dampers},
journal={Granular Matter},
year={2021},
month={Apr},
day={10},
volume={23},
number={2},
pages={45},
abstract={We study, via discrete element method simulations, the apparent mass (m, the ratio of a driving force to a resulting acceleration) and loss factor ({\$}{\$}{\backslash}eta{\$}{\$}, the ratio of dissipated to stored energy) of granular dampers attached to a vertically driven, single degree of freedom mechanical system. Granular dampers (or particle dampers) consist in receptacles that contain macroscopic particles which dissipate energy, when they are subjected to vibration, thanks to the inelastic collisions and friction between them. Although many studies focus on {\$}{\$}{\backslash}eta{\$}{\$}, less work has been devoted to m. The apparent mass of granular dampers is an important characteristic since the grains, which are free to move or collide inside their receptacle, act as a non-constant and time-dependent mass which alters the mass of the main vibrating system in a non-trivial way. In particular, it has been recently demonstrated (Masmoudi et al. in Granul Matter 18:71, 2016) that m non-linearly depends on the driving acceleration {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varGamma{\$}{\$}according to a power law, {\$}{\$}m{\backslash}propto {\backslash}varGamma ^k{\$}{\$}. Experiments using three-dimensional (3D) packings of particles suggest {\$}{\$}k=-2{\$}{\$}. However, simulations with one-dimensional (1D) columns of particles on a vibrating plate and theoretical predictions based on the inelastic bouncing ball model (IBBM) suggest that {\$}{\$}k=-1{\$}{\$}. These findings opened questions as to whether the apparent mass, which relies on how linear momentum is transferred from the damper to the primary system, depends on the dimensionality of the packing or on lateral interactions between walls and grains. Interestingly, {\$}{\$}{\backslash}eta{\$}{\$}was shown to follow a universal curve, {\$}{\$}{\backslash}eta {\backslash}propto {\backslash}varGamma ^{\{}-1{\}}{\$}{\$}, whatever the dimensionality and the constraints in the motion of the grains. In this work, we consider granular dampers without a lid under different confinement conditions in the motion of the particles (1D, quasi-1D, quasi-2D and full 3D). We find that the mechanical response of the granular damper (m and {\$}{\$}{\backslash}eta{\$}{\$}) is not sensitive to the lateral confinement or dimensionality. However, we have observed two distinct regimes, depending on whether the driving frequency is above or below the resonant frequency of the primary system. In the inertial regime, {\$}{\$}{\backslash}eta{\$}{\$}decays according to the IBBM for all dimensions, {\$}{\$}{\backslash}eta {\backslash}propto {\backslash}varGamma ^{\{}-1{\}}{\$}{\$}, while m falls as {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varGamma ^{\{}-2{\}}{\$}{\$}for all dimensions, in agreement with Masmoudi's experiments. However, the power law for m is valid only for moderate acceleration, before becoming negative at high accelerations. In the quasi-static regime, both m and {\$}{\$}{\backslash}eta{\$}{\$}display a complex behavior as functions of the excitation amplitude, but the mean trend is consistent with the IBBM predictions, i.e., {\$}{\$}m{\backslash}propto {\backslash}varGamma ^{\{}-1{\}}{\$}{\$}and {\$}{\$}{\backslash}eta {\backslash}propto {\backslash}varGamma ^{\{}-1{\}}{\$}{\$}.},

abstract = {Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is a well established technique used to measure displacements in fluids. Proppant transport and placement is a crucial phase in the process of well completion to stimulate production in gas and oil reservoirs. Proppant (a granular material) is injected along fluids during hydraulic stimulation to prop fractures open after hydrocarbon production is initiated. This work presents results on the use of PIV for the study of the transport of proppant in a large laboratory scale flat vertical fracture. Velocity and vorticity profiles were analyzed for different flow rates during the transport and settlement of the proppant inside the fracture. High flow rates, compatible with field operations are achieved in this setup. The results indicate that vortexes are present in a large portion of the system and that a non-linear interplay between the settling dune and the main vortex seems to determine the time at which a fast dune growth occurs in the fracture.}
